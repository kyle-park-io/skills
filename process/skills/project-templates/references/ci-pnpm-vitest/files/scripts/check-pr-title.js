// Harvested from jarvis (scripts/check-pr-title.js), written there to satisfy the "Check the PR
// title" step in this piece's .github/workflows/ci.yml -- which until now referenced a script the
// piece did not carry. Verified in jarvis: PR #20 and #21, both green, the step printing
// "PR title OK: ...".
//
// The RULE below is jarvis's: English subjects, Conventional Commits. The SHAPE transfers; the
// rule may not. Read this piece's README.md ("바꿔야 할 것") before keeping it as-is.

// Guards the one piece of text on a pull request that nothing else checks.
//
// This repo squash-merges with squash_merge_commit_title=COMMIT_OR_PR_TITLE, so for a PR carrying
// more than one commit the *pull request title* becomes the commit subject on main. Branch commits
// are reviewed; the title is reviewed by nothing.
//
// The title arrives through PR_TITLE and is never interpolated into a shell command -- a title
// holding a backtick or $(...) would otherwise run on the runner. See .github/workflows/ci.yml.
